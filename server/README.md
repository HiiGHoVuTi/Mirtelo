# Mirtelo server

## Installation

The Mirtelo server has two dependencies: [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and [mongodb server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Once both are installed and mongodb is running (mongod command), you can simply run:
```bash
stack run
```

## Plugins
